Verse:
Em	                    Hm
I'm Sitting Here In A Boring Room
Em                             Hm
It's Just Another Rainy Sunday Afternoon
Em                        Hm
I'm Wasting My Time I Got Nothing To Do
Em                     Hm
I'm Hanging Around I'm Waiting For You
    Am                   Hm      Em
But Nothing Ever Happens - And I Wonder

I'm Driving Around In My Car
I'm Driving Too Fast I'm Driving Too Far
I'd Like To Change My Point Of View
I Feel So Lonely I'm Waiting For You
But Nothing Ever Happens - And I Wonder

Chorus :
G              D
I Wonder How I Wonder Why
Em                              Hm
Yesterday You Told Me 'bout The Blue Blue Sky
C                  D                    G         D
And All That I Can See Is Just A Yellow Lemon-tree

G                   D
I'm Turning My Head Up And Down
Em                                  Hm
I'm Turning Turning Turning Turning Turning Around
C                  A                    D
And All That I Can See Is Just A Yellow Lemon-tree

Bridge1 : Em Hm Em Hm Am Hm Em
          dadada....

I'm Sitting Here I Miss The Power
I'd Like To Go Out Taking A Shower
But There's A Heavy Cloud Inside My Head
I Feel So Tired Put Myself Into Bed
Where Nothing Ever Happens - And I Wonder


Bridge2 :
H           Em
Isolation - Is Not Good For Me
D           G               D
Isolation - I Don't Want To Sit On A Lemon-tree


I'm Steppin' Around In A Desert Of Joy
Baby Anyhow I'll Get Another Toy
And Everything Will Happen - And You'll Wonder

I Wonder How I Wonder Why
Yesterday You Told Me 'bout The Blue Blue Sky
And All That I Can See Is Just A Yellow Lemon-tree
I'm Turning My Head Up And Down
I'm Turning Turning Turning Turning Turning Around

C                  D             G
And All That I Can See Is Just A Yellow Lemon-tree
D
And I wonder I wonder

I Wonder How I Wonder Why
Yesterday You Told Me 'bout The Blue Blue Sky

C                  D
And All That I Can See
C                  D
And All That I Can See
C                  D
And All That I Can See
                 G
Is Just A Yellow Lemon-tree.
